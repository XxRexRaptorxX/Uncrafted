## üìñ Description

Uncrafted is a mod which adds many new recipes for already existing items and blocks. With this mod it's possible to craft spawners, bedrock, spawn eggs, name tags, and maaany more..

-----

- no new blocks or items were added. Only crafting and smelting recipes for vanilla Minecraft.
- currently over 200 new crafting and smelting recipes!
- if you need a mod to break placed bedrock, command blocks, etc. use my other mod [Bedrock Miner](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bedrock-miner)!

----

Note: There's different recipes in different Minecraft versions, I suggest you to use [JEI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei), [NEI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/notenoughitems), TMI or any other recipe viewer mod to see the right recipes! :)
